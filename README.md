<h2>This repository is mostly a placeholder, it will be built using TypeScript, Commander, and pkg. The original project will be used as an integration.</h2>

<h3 align="center">
A CLI to automatically skip anime opening and ending sequences, making it easier to watch your favorite shows without having to manually skip the intros and outros each time.
</h3>

**Important:** There's a chance `ani-skip` may not recognize the anime you're watching. It leverages the [aniskip API](https://api.aniskip.com/api-docs). If an anime's episode(s) are missing, you can contribute or request its inclusion on our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/UqT55CbrbE).

## Troubleshooting Errors

Should you run into problems, first ensure you're using the most recent version:

- For Linux, Mac, and Android:
  ```bash
  sudo ani-skip -U
  ```

- For Windows:
  Open Git Bash as an administrator and enter:
  ```bash
  ani-skip -U
  ```

If the issue remains unresolved, please create a new issue.

## Usage

<pre>
$ ani-skip
ani-skip ["title"] [ep]
# title -> Precise anime title that can be retrieved during anime selection (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli">ani-cli</a> anime selection)
# ep -> episode number
</pre>

> `script-opts` with the `script` flag is produced by ani-skip when metadata for a specific anime's skip times exists in the database. It's important to append these flags at the end due to certain mpv nuances.

```sh
$ ani-skip "Black Clover (170 episode)" 10
--script-opts=skip-op_start=140.153,skip-op_end=230.153,skip-ed_start=1301.824,skip-ed_end=1431 '--script=/home/kali/.config/mpv/scripts/skip.lua'
$ mpv "black_clover_ep10.mp4" $(ani-skip "Black Clover (170 episode)" 10)
```
